## Africa to Silicon Valley

A2SV helps smart students from universities get better at technology and find good jobs at top companies worldwide. They also make apps to solve big problems in their own countries. It's free for students who can't afford it but are really good at what they do. 

This place is like a big library where students can learn about tricky problems and how to solve them using computers. There are different sections for different types of problems, like puzzles. Each section has a problem to solve and an answer. You can also find answers for problems from other places, but you'll need to look for the questions somewhere else.

## Get started

To get started, just pick a problem you like and read what it's about. Then, check out the solution to see how it's done. You can try solving the problem yourself too, and see if your solution is similar to mine. It's like a game to see who can solve the problem the best! If you want to learn more, you can visit the website www.a2sv.org and join us there.
